====== Networking ======
Created Sunday 17 September 2017

* Configuration automation
	* Push configuration changes out to network elements
* Test-driven networking
	* It's not good enough to simply push a configuration into a device. One must be able to take ephemeral state information and apply it to configuration management. 
	* Must be able to evaluate if device is transitioning to the steady operating state that we expect.
	* Must be able to turn UP the interface, look at its various characteristics and make sure its steady before continung. We can look @ LLDP peers, route entries in route table, etc. 
* Continuous compliance
	* Once we understand what the ephemeral state is, we can go back and test configuration changes to make sure they remain over the course of time. 

**Core Network Modules**
* Command modules
	* Extract data out of a network device
* Config modules
* Template modules
	* work with existing configuration files

Using Ansible's "check" functionality, we can see what change a particular playbook will make to a device without altering the device's configuration. 
	* Allows user to get very comfortable working with Ansible and see how Ansible would have made a particular configuration change
